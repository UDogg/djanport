# djanport
My first dynamic portfolio
It is very tiring to go inside the source code and update project/experiences etc whenver I get a new job/ create more projects- python helps us automate all of that with django.
In django all you need to do is go to the admin panel and add your new jobs/projects etc. 
This project is a very basic django portfolio from which I will take inspiration and build my final portfolio website and deploy it to vercel.
My final website will have a django backend for automation of new jobs and have ReactJs for frontend because it is the most popular frontend framework.
